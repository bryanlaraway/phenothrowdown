## About

This repo will contain all scripts necessary to perform the OWLSim vs Phenolog work. 

Requires creation of multiple directories. Copy the folders from the 'phenothrowdown_subfolders' directory in my thesis Dropbox (Laraway Phenologs Thesis/Data/phenothrowdown_subfolders/) and dump all subfolders into your local phenothrowdown directory.

NOTE: This branch will serve as the archived 'data production for thesis' branch. Additional code cleanup and documentation will be performed on the master branch.
